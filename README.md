Generic Resources for STL Python

stlpython.pdf is a door sign to be printed for meetups to help people know they found the right place.

To print the Suggestions.md create a bookmark/favorite in your browser with the link content set to:

```javascript:var content = document. querySelector('article'); var body = document.querySelector('body'); body.innerHTML = ''; body.appendChild(content);```

all in one line which will let you print just the body of the content with markdown.
